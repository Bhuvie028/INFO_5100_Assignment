Project Description:
1. Covid-Variant Ecosystem is a Java Swing Application that is used to analyze data fetched from all areas of COVID healthcare systems and categories COVID affected patients from the type of variant they are carrying
2. This system also keeps a track of medicine being given to the COVID patients carrying a particular variant by updating the database as to which set of medicines can cure a patient with that Variant
3. This system maintains statistical data of all the active compounds that are effective in targeting a particular COVID variant (Say alpha) and helps in forwarding the Variant compounds and molecules to research lab for further study.
4. If a patient is detected with a variant already present in the database, a particular set of prescribed medicines are given to the patient effective to cure a certain COVID variant
5. If the patient is detected with a Variant that is not present the records, it is treated as a new Variant and the medicines effective on this variant are processed through clinical trails in laboratory.

Business Approach:
1. COVID-Variant combines COVID related data coming from different enterprises of COVID healthcare system to help generating vaccines and medicines to cure a particular Variant.
2. To focus on the development, manufacturing and marketing of new medicines and vaccines for the treatment of a new COVID Variant in COVID affected patients anywhere in the world.
3. Vaccine enterprise keeps tracks of the new COVID variant and their targeting certain molecules that help to generate antibodies for a certain variant. This way, a vaccine manufacturer can create a new vaccine in the future when a new COVID variant is discovered by combination of existing variants to avoid any delays in manufacturing a new vaccine.

Conclusion:
1. This concludes that adopting a certain global data collection standard and upgrading COVID healthcare value system would benefit Covid-Variant eco-system in further improvements of patient care. 
2. Also, a cost-effective healthcare can be provided to millions of patients across the country by following the covid-variant Ecosystem approach..
3. Monitoring inventory across multiple enterprises helps in faster deliver of vaccines and medicines to COVID affected patients.
4. It will also help us to keep a track of patients carrying new variants.
